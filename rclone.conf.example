# Example Rclone Configuration for Google Drive (OAuth)
#
# This project uses OAuth authentication, NOT service accounts.
#
# To create your rclone.conf with OAuth:
#   1. Run: rclone config
#   2. Choose: n (New remote)
#   3. Name: gdrive (or your preferred name)
#   4. Type: drive (Google Drive)
#   5. Client ID/Secret: Press Enter (use defaults, or provide your own)
#   6. Scope: drive (full access recommended for backups)
#   7. Root folder: Press Enter
#   8. Service account file: Press Enter (leave blank - we're using OAuth!)
#   9. Edit advanced config: n
#   10. Use auto config: y (opens browser for OAuth login)
#   11. Log in with your Google account and authorize
#
# After configuration, copy the generated config:
#   - From: ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
#   - To your deployment location (VM, Docker host, etc.)
#
# IMPORTANT: Never commit the real rclone.conf to version control!
# It contains OAuth tokens that provide access to your Google Drive.

[gdrive]
type = drive
scope = drive
# OAuth token (automatically populated by rclone config)
token = {"access_token":"YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN","token_type":"Bearer","refresh_token":"YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN","expiry":"2024-12-31T23:59:59.000000000Z"}

# Optional: For Google Workspace Shared Drives (Team Drives)
# If you're using a Shared Drive instead of My Drive:
# 1. Get the Shared Drive ID from the URL when viewing it in Google Drive
# 2. Uncomment the line below and add your Shared Drive ID
# team_drive = 0AaBbCcDdEeFfGg

# Optional: Additional remotes for different environments
[gdrive_production]
type = drive
scope = drive
token = {"access_token":"PROD_ACCESS_TOKEN","token_type":"Bearer","refresh_token":"PROD_REFRESH_TOKEN","expiry":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000000000Z"}

[gdrive_staging]
type = drive
scope = drive
token = {"access_token":"STAGING_ACCESS_TOKEN","token_type":"Bearer","refresh_token":"STAGING_REFRESH_TOKEN","expiry":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000000000Z"}

# Notes:
# - The 'scope' setting controls what permissions rclone has:
#   - 'drive.file' = Only access files created by rclone (limited)
#   - 'drive' = Full access to Google Drive (recommended for backups)
#   - 'drive.readonly' = Read-only access
#
# - OAuth tokens refresh automatically using the refresh_token
# - Access tokens expire after ~1 hour, but refresh tokens last months/years
# - If you see "invalid_grant" errors, reconnect OAuth:
#   Run: rclone config reconnect gdrive:
#
# - This project does NOT use service accounts
# - OAuth works with both personal Google accounts and Google Workspace
# - No special Google Cloud project setup required (uses rclone's built-in OAuth app)
