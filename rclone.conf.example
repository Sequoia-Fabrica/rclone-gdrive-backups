# Example Rclone Configuration for Google Drive
# Copy this file to rclone.conf and fill in your actual OAuth credentials
#
# To create a real rclone.conf:
#   1. Run: rclone config
#   2. Choose: n (New remote)
#   3. Name: gdrive (or your preferred name)
#   4. Type: drive (Google Drive)
#   5. Follow the OAuth flow
#   6. Copy the generated config from ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
#
# IMPORTANT: Never commit the real rclone.conf to version control!
# It contains OAuth tokens that provide access to your Google Drive.

# Notes:
# - The 'scope' setting controls what permissions rclone has:
#   - 'drive.file' = Only access files created by rclone
#   - 'drive' = Full access to Google Drive (recommended for backups)
#   - 'drive.readonly' = Read-only access
#
# - OAuth tokens refresh automatically, but if you see "invalid_grant" errors:
#   Run: rclone config reconnect gdrive:
#
# - For service accounts (Google Workspace), add:
#   service_account_file = /etc/rclone/service_account.json
#   (This method requires additional Google Workspace setup)
